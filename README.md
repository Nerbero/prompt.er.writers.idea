Licenza
Questo progetto √® rilasciato sotto la GNU General Public License v3.0. Di seguito il testo completo della licenza:

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3, 27 June 2007
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. https://fsf.org/
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Copyright (c) 2025 Ernesto Lamberti

Preamble
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, this General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use this General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can use it too for your programs.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and developers' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as such, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to The Free Software Foundation or to the original authors.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to forbid the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
0. Definitions.

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the Program.

To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, redistribution, reverse engineering, display, performance, and public transmission.

A "contributed work" is the Program, or any work based on the Program, that has been contributed to the Free Software Foundation.

A "corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the source code for the work, including any interface definition files and scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the Corresponding Source need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

The Corresponding Source for a work in module form means the module's source code, plus any scripts used to control compilation and installation of the module.

1. Source Code.

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. "Object code" means any form of a work that is not source code.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output, constituting a covered work, is propagated.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not propagate, without any conditions.

You may propagate covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with the terms of this License in propagating all material for which you do not control the copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

3. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

4. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the Program itself if it has been modified, in the form of source code under the terms of section 3, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code.
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how it is packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate permission you may have received to license other parts of the work separately.
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display "An appropriate copyright notice" (as defined in section 3) and a notice that the work is released under this License and that there is no warranty. (However, if the Program is an interactive user interface but does not normally display such a notice, your work need not make it do so.)

5. Conveying Non-Source Versions.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 3 and 4, provided that you also convey the Corresponding Source for the work.

a) The Corresponding Source must be in a medium customarily used for software interchange.
b) The Corresponding Source must be in a medium customarily used for software interchange, or you must provide a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing this distribution of source, a complete machine-readable copy of the Corresponding Source, which is to be distributed under the terms of sections 3 and 4, and which is to be delivered on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
c) The Corresponding Source must be in a medium customarily used for software interchange, or you must provide a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing this distribution of source, a complete machine-readable copy of the Corresponding Source, which is to be distributed under the terms of sections 3 and 4, and which is to be delivered on a medium customarily used for software interchange.

6. Conveying Non-Source Versions.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 3 and 4, provided that you also convey the Corresponding Source for the work.

a) The Corresponding Source must be in a medium customarily used for software interchange.
b) The Corresponding Source must be in a medium customarily used for software interchange, or you must provide a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing this distribution of source, a complete machine-readable copy of the Corresponding Source, which is to be distributed under the terms of sections 3 and 4, and which is to be delivered on a medium customarily used for software interchange.
c) The Corresponding Source must be in a medium customarily used for software interchange, or you must provide a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing this distribution of source, a complete machine-readable copy of the Corresponding Source, which is to be distributed under the terms of sections 3 and 4, and which is to be delivered on a medium customarily used for software interchange.

7. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this License by making exceptions to one or more of its conditions. "Non-permissive terms" are terms that purport to deny or limit permissions granted by this License. If you add additional permissions to a covered work, you must mark the added permissions as such.

If you add non-permissive terms to a covered work, you must mark the added terms as such.

If you add additional permissions to a covered work, you must mark the added permissions as such.

If you add non-permissive terms to a covered work, you must mark the added terms as such.

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify a covered work is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses granted under section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to your cessation of the violation.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Every time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

11. Patents.

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by making, using, or selling their contributor version of the Program.

You grant every recipient of the Program or a work based on the Program a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import, and otherwise transfer the Program or a work based on the Program.

This patent license is granted only for the contributor's contributor version, and for any modified versions of the contributor version. This patent license does not extend to any other versions of the Program or a work based on the Program.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If you are subject to judicial order or other governmental regulation that prevents you from complying with any of the terms of this License, you may not convey a covered work.

13. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If you are subject to judicial order or other governmental regulation that prevents you from complying with any of the terms of this License, you may not convey a covered work.

HOW TO APPLY THESE TERMS TO YOUR NEW PROGRAMS
If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
